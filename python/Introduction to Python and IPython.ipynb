Several years ago, the folks in charge of Python realized that they needed to make some serious changes in the language that would mean old software would no longer run, thus breaking what software engineers call \"backward compatibility.\" As a result, for several more years, Python will be split into two major camps, corresponding to Python 2 (the old version) and Python 3 (the new). For basic users, the differences are very minor, but for sophisticated programs, it can take quite a bit of work bringing Python 2 code into Python 3. \n",

You can view the python shell as a similar type of program, except, instead of talking to the operating system, the shell talks to the Python interpreter.
