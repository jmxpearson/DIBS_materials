Several years ago, the folks in charge of Python realized that they needed to make some serious changes in the language that would mean old software would no longer run, thus breaking what software engineers call \"backward compatibility.\" As a result, it's taken several years, but as of now, nearly all major Python packages have been ported to Python 3, and ongoing development of Python 2 packages has (or will soon be) discontinued.\n",

    "Python is a good language, and easier to learn than many. But learning to program isn't actually the hard part. The hard part is doing the actual analysis, which often means finding tools that make the analysis possible. Since most of us aren't professional-grade programmers, we use code written by others to do our science. And when that code isn't readily available, it makes our lives needlessly difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of which is to say **we teach Python because Python has the tools for scientific computing**. There are lots and lots and lots of libraries for Python, and in the last several years, these have coalesced around a bunch of key technologies, including\n",
    "- the standard Python libraries, which define the language\n",
    "- `NumPy`, which defines a fast, efficient array that can be used for heavy number crunching\n",
    "- `SciPy`, which includes functions for signal processing, special functions, and statistics\n",
    "- `Pandas`, which defines a type of object called a data frame for organizing and manipulating data sets\n",
    "- `Matplotlib`, `bokeh`, `seaborn`, and a host more for plotting\n",
    "- `statsmodels` and `patsy` for defining and fitting statistical models like regressions\n",
    "- `Scikit-learn` for machine learning\n",
    "- `Scikit-image` and `PIL` for image processing\n",
    "- `Cython`, `PyPy`, `blaze`, and `Shed Skin` for making your code run *fast*\n",
    "- `SymPy` for computer algebra (think Mathematica)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even more important, if you work with neuroscience data, there are tremendously good libraries available:\n",
    "- for MRI: [NIPy](http://nipy.org) is a whole set of related tools for cleaning and analyzing MRI data\n",
    "- for EEG/MEG: there is less dominance here, but [MNE](http://martinos.org/mne/stable/mne-python.html) ([paper](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fnins.2013.00267/full)) seems to be quite good\n",
    "- for spikes: Unfortunately, there isn't nearly as much here. This is because single unit electrophysiologists believe they are smarter than everyone else and generally refuse to run anything but their own code. In truth, it's because these data require a little less cleaning and processing. Once the spikes are sorted (lots of options there), some analysis is available [here](https://github.com/OpenElectrophy/OpenElectrophy) and [here](https://github.com/chrox/RealTimeElectrophy), while my code is [here](https://github.com/jmxpearson/physutils)\n",
    "- for coding behavioral experiments: [Psychophysics Toolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org) has been the go-to solution with Matlab. On the Python side, I like [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org). (See also [my blog post](http://jmxpearson.com/2014/06/05/further-adventures-in-pythonism.html) on this.)\n",
    "- for simulations of neural networks, [Brian](http://briansimulator.org/) and [PyNN](http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/) make what the formerly excruciating routine.\n",
    "- for Bayesian analysis, there are [PyStan](https://pystan.readthedocs.org/), [PyMC](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc/), and [emcee](http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/)"

    "Almost a decade ago, Fernando Perez began the [IPython project](http://www.ipython.org) to design a better version of the Python shell. As you'll recall, the shell is itself just another program. It gets input from the user, talks to the file system and operating system, and runs other commands/programs. You can view the python shell as a similar type of program, except, instead of talking to the operating system, the shell talks to the Python interpreter. IPython simply replaces the old Python shell with something much more flexible and powerful."
